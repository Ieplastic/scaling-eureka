The quest for waste plastics indentification via lidar
Hey Everyone, I am interested in developing a mini lidar into a handheld tool for 6 basic plastics recgnition. I am the mechanical design engineer at Scarabtech Inc in South Africa. I have developed machines that extract usable fuels from waste plastic. My problem is onsite identification of plastics. I have also done some research on lidar at science level and realized that the machines the use are complex to achieve complex results. It also cost a fortune and not mobile. what i want to establish is a haldheld tool that can be used by industry and also household level. Our work involves a lot of community education and outreach. My work is more mechanical design and development. i have some understanding about electronics but have no experience in software. I would like to collaborate with anyone who can assist me in achieving my goal. My direct email is Pops@scarabtech.com.
We have two websites; Dungbeetle.africa and Scarabtech.com.
